# Caribou Resource Selection Function
Dominic Cyr  

Updated on Sep 20 2016

-------

In this repo you will find everything necessary to compute resource selection function (RSF) for Caribou (forest-dweling ecotype) from Landis-II outputs. The current RSF is based on telemetric observations of 121 caribous belonging to 7 herds between 2004 and 2012 in Qu√©bec, Canada.

The RSF is currently implemented for a specific area north of the Lac St-Jean, but should be relatively easily adaptable.

1. Clone the repo on your machine (or [download manually][2]).
2. Specify a few user-defined variables in '_simProcessCaribouRSF.R_'.
3. Run '_simProcessCaribouRSF.R_'.
